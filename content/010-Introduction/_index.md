Overview
GSol is still an early stage project and aims at helping business organizations engage at the right time with their online customers by:

Tracking customer journeys and observe behaviors to engage at the right time
Reducing abandonment rate and optimize successful conversion
Increasing revenue by offering targeted discounts
Deflecting customers with online FAQ and chatbots
 

The following scenarios showcase the benefits of the prospect conversion across the different customer lifecycle as follow:

Goals	Customer Lifecycle	Scenario
Capture Lead Information	Lead Generation	A prospect is using GSol savings calculator to understand the ROI for such Solar investment. Genesys Prospection Center captures lead information directly from the website (address, estimated cost, 30yr value) and engage with high value leads in real-time.
 
Increase shopping cart value	Online Sales	A prospect wants to install his own solar roof and explores our GSol Solar Panels inventory. After finding what he’s looking for, the prospect adds 8 panels ($1,799.99) into its cart and keep exploring the online shop before receiving a promocode from the Genesys Prospection Center. The Gold prospect (high value cart) is now eligible for a $100 discount with a minimum purchase of $2000. Our prospect is satisfied with this upsell opportunities because now he gets the battery to power his Solar roof with a significant discount and GSol converted the sales.
 
Reduce Abandonment rate	Customer Care	Our customer receives GSol monthly newsletter and is informed about our latest FAQ.  The FAQ redirects GSol customer to review the online maintenance guide to get the best efficiency of their Solar roof with information to take care of their batteries. The customer didn’t take good care of his battery so he is considering buying a new one to get a better solar efficiency but he abandons the online order before checkout. Genesys Prospection Center identifies the missed opportunity and offers a proactive chat to support the customer with a sales specialist and secure the deal.
