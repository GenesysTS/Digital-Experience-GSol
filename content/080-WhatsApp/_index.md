GSol bot can join a WhatsApp conversation at  +1 (317) 210-8599 if the very first message of the conversation is “Hi GSol” (case insensitive).

The bot can answer questions:

1. What are the benefits of solar panels? / What will I get with solar panels?
2. What is the lifespan of solar panels? / Do solar panels ever wear out? / How long do solar panels last?
3. Is it difficult to maintain solar panels? / Does cleaning your solar panels make a difference? / Do solar panels need a lot of maintenance?
4. How many solar panels do I need? / What should be the size of my solar system?


In addition, you can use any intent of the Self-Service Chat bot scenario before proceeding to an agent transfer.
