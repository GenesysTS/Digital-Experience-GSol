To illustrate this personalization, we created 3 segments \u0026lsquo;High Value Shopper\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Customer Care Needed\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;Customer\u0026rsquo; and we are using Genesys Predictive Engagement to update the customer segment based on the customer web activities in this demo.\nSelf-Service Bot If you do not visit the website, a voice bot will be offered to you. For additional reference, please refer to the \u0026ldquo;scenario: self-service bot\u0026rdquo; section. You can also reset the customer segment using the link in the footer \u0026lsquo;Reset Customer Segment\u0026rsquo; to demo the voice bot.\nSales Support Scenario. A known visitor arrives at the GSol GDemo website. The visitor places item(s) in a shopping cart:\nGenesys Predictive Engagement identifies the visitor as a Segment “High-Value Shopper” based upon the shopping cart dollar amount value or based upon the specific items placed into the cart. Select the Renogy Solar Panel item (+$500) The Visitor calls the Business “GSol”. When a Segment is matched prior to a call, the Segment may be correlated with a “Call Intent”. An inbound call Architect Flow recognizes the visitor and the matched “High-Value Shopper Segment” and plays an audible IVR prompt “Hello xxx. Are you calling about the items in your shopping cart today? Say ‘yes’ or press 1 to be routed to a Sales Specialist. Route the call the appropriate Queue/Skill/Agent As the Agent answers the call, the GPE Customer Journey, Identity Stitching journey visualization may be selected and displayed.
